(1) To compile and generate an executable for the input viewer, type the following (without quotes) in the terminal:

`make`

(2) After step 1, you will have an executable called `inputSorter` in this folder. 

(3) To sort an input file named `n100records.in` and to store the sorted records in an output folder called `n100records.out`, you should type in the following 

`./inputSorted -i n100records.in -o n100records.out`
